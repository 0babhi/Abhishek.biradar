## Introducing Today's Project!

In this project, I will demonstrate... I'm doing this project to learn... vpc want to know how changes can be made 

## Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)

### What I did in this step

In this step, I will..create  a virtual private cloud. because...so that all the changes can be done in an isloate envinrment

### How VPCs work

VPCs are...vpc are virtual provide cloud think of it as having the a section of city wit its own rule the city rules wont apply yo VPC 

### Why there is a default VPC in AWS accounts

There was already a default VPC in my account ever since my AWS account was created. This is because... all the instance which  we created are hosted in that vpc so every thing is hosted in that vpc section

### Defining IPv4 CIDR blocks

To set up my VPC, I had to define an IPv4 CIDR block, which is...like naming with number and after that /16
it shows we can assign the number from 10.0.255.255   so there are nealy 65k subnets we can assign

## Subnets

### What I did in this step

In this step, I will... create a subnet because...subnet are the main nodes of the vpc which host the data , 

### Creating and configuring subnets

Subnets are... the nodes in vpc  There are already subnets existing in my account, one for every...avialibilty zones which are like datacentere in that availibility zones                                          

### Public vs private subnets

The difference between public and private subnets are... For a subnet to be considered public, it has to...haveto  be accessable through internet sinc this comes after that NACL and gateway we can do chnages and craete a public subnet

### Auto-assigning public IPv4 addresses

Once I created my subnet, I enabled...auto assign ipv4 address This setting makes sure... that the subnet is assigned an ip for itself so that...that assimanual ip assiging gets removed and all  the ips are unique to itself

## Internet gateways

### What I did in this step

In this step, I will...create a internet gateway  because...the internet is responsible for the internet access like connecting to internet

### Setting up internet gateways

Internet gateways are...its aprotocal which helps the subnet to connect to the internet

Attaching an internet gateway to a VPC means...that the subnet can use this as an bridge to acccess the internet If I missed this step...i would not have been able to use internet from that subnet and to make  it becomes public

## Using the AWS CLI

### What I'm doing in this extension

In this project extension, I will... because...is to use the AWS CLI to launch your VPC's resources... and report back on whether it was a faster, more efficient way to do this project.

### Exploring CloudShell and CLI

VPC resources could also be created with CloudShell, which is... CLI is...aws s own command line interface 

### Debugging my setup

To set up a VPC or a subnet, you can use the command... Make sure to avoid errors by including... i didnt mention the cidr-block  for new command i used --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/25   which create ta sebnet instance

### Comparing CloudShell vs AWS Console

Compared to using the AWS Console, an advantage of using commands is... An advantage of using the Console is...using CLI it saves much time compared to using GUI  Overall, I preferred... for practice GUI for work CLI would we greate
